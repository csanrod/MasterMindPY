## Description
The game involves guessing a secret multi-digit number on successive attempts. Every
one of the digits of the secret number will be randomly generated.

On each attempt, you will enter a number. The program will compare the secret number
with the attempt typed and will offer the following information on the screen: 

  - How many digits match and are in their position (correct) 
  - How many digits match, but they are not in their position (half correct)
  
## Rules
1. You will need to set the difficulty:

    - Basic (3 digits --> [0-4], 6 attempts)
    - Normal (4 digits --> [0-5], 8 attempts)
    - Hard (5 digits --> [0-9], 10 attempts)
  
2. Then select if you want repeated digits on your secret number or not

3. Finally, the game will start with the selected configuration. Enjoy!
